# Workforce ERP — Phases 1-9

**A note on updating this project:** every phase is delivered as the same
`erp-project` folder (client/ + server/) — always extract a new zip **on
top of** your existing folder, overwriting files, rather than into a new
sibling folder. That keeps Git seeing "these files changed" instead of "two
unrelated projects," which avoids the merge-conflict trap of one folder per
phase. Run `git pull` before you start layering in a new phase if you've
made any commits of your own in between.

Phases 2-8 delivered the whole backend: auth/RBAC, org management,
attendance, leave, tasks, goals/performance, and communication. Phase 9
adds the analytics layer the dashboards needed, builds out the Manager and
HR/Admin dashboards with real charts, and ships a full demo dataset so the
app looks like a real, populated product instead of an empty shell. The
Workforce Command Center + office map and formal reports/exports still
don't exist yet — those start in Phase 10.

## Phase 9: Dashboards, analytics, and seed data

**Backend additions**
- `analytics.service.js` (HR/Admin only) - four read-only aggregate
  endpoints that the earlier phases didn't have a reason to build yet:
  - `GET /analytics/overview`: today's org-wide attendance breakdown,
    pending leave count, overdue task count, and holidays in the next 30
    days, all in one call so the dashboard header doesn't need five
    round-trips
  - `GET /analytics/attendance-trend?days=14`: daily present/absent/leave/
    remote counts for a trend chart - reads only days that have actual
    Attendance records (i.e. have been through check-in or the Phase 4
    absentee sweep), so an unprocessed day just doesn't show a bar instead
    of silently showing zero
  - `GET /analytics/task-completion-by-department` and
    `/headcount-by-department`: bucketed for bar charts
  - Manager and Employee dashboards needed **no new backend work** - they
    compose data the API already exposed (`/attendance/team`,
    `/tasks/team`, `/leaves/team`, `/performance/team`, `/goals/me`,
    `/holidays`, `/announcements`, `/recognitions/me`), which is itself a
    decent sign the earlier phases' APIs were shaped sensibly
- `server/seed/seed.js` - a full demo dataset: 1 admin, 1 HR, 3 managers,
  16 employees across 3 teams/2 departments/1 office, ~4 weeks of
  attendance history per person (weighted toward "present" with a
  realistic mix of remote/half-day/absent/late), a completed leave +
  matching Attendance/LeaveBalance side effects for everyone, one *live*
  pending leave request per manager so there's something to approve
  immediately, 3-5 tasks per employee (including some overdue, for the
  dashboards to have something to flag), 1-2 goals per employee, a
  performance snapshot with manager-entered quality/collaboration scores
  and a feedback comment, a dozen recognitions, 3 announcements at
  different audience scopes, and 2 holidays (one past, one upcoming).
  Run with `npm run seed` from `server/`

**Frontend additions**
- **HR/Admin dashboard**: overview cards (employees, present today, pending
  leaves, overdue tasks), a 14-day attendance trend line chart, headcount
  and task-completion bar charts by department, and an upcoming-holidays
  list - all real Recharts components, not placeholders
- **Manager dashboard**: today's team attendance as a bar chart, task
  completion with a breakdown, pending leave count, team average
  contribution score, and goals-in-progress count - built entirely from
  data the Manager APIs from Phases 4-7 already returned
- **Employee dashboard**: rounded out with the three pieces the original
  brief asked for that hadn't landed yet - upcoming holidays, recent
  announcements, and recent recognition, alongside the attendance/leave/
  goals/performance widgets from earlier phases

```

### How to test Phase 9

1. From `server/`, run `npm run seed` (make sure `MONGO_URI` in `.env`
   points at a database you're fine wiping - the script clears existing
   data first). It prints login credentials for every seeded account at
   the end; the demo password is the same for all of them
   (`Password123!`).
2. Log in as `admin@nimbuslabs.io` - the dashboard should immediately show
   a populated attendance trend, headcount by department, and task
   completion charts instead of empty states.
3. Log in as one of the three managers (e.g. `marcus.chen@nimbuslabs.io`) -
   their dashboard should show their specific team's attendance/tasks/
   performance, and **Leave requests** should already have one pending
   request waiting (seeded via the real `applyForLeave` service call, so
   it's a genuine live request, not a fake status).
4. Log in as any seeded employee (e.g. `liam.johnson@nimbuslabs.io`) - the
   dashboard should show real attendance history, a completed leave in
   their history, a couple of tasks (check whether any show as overdue),
   goals, a contribution score with manager feedback attached, and the new
   holidays/announcements/recognition widgets all populated.
5. Confirm the numbers roughly make sense against each other - e.g. the
   employee count on the HR dashboard should match `16 + 3 managers + 1 HR
   + 1 admin = 21`, and a manager's team size on their dashboard should
   match how many people are listed under their team in Phase 3's Teams
   page.

## Phase 8: Notifications + communication

The brief's notification list was: leave approval/rejection (Phase 5), new
task (Phase 6), **task deadline**, **announcement**, **recognition**,
manager feedback (Phase 7), goal updates (Phase 7). This phase fills in the
three still missing - which meant building the features that generate them
(announcements, recognition) alongside the notification wiring itself, plus
messaging since it's the other half of "communication" in the brief.

**Backend additions**
- **Task deadline reminders**: `POST /notifications/check-task-deadlines`
  (HR/Admin) sweeps for non-completed tasks due within N hours (default 24)
  and haven't already gotten a reminder (`Task.reminderSentAt`, so re-running
  the sweep doesn't spam). Same manual-trigger-for-now pattern as
  `mark-absentees` from Phase 4 - the natural Phase 12 cron target
- **`Announcement`** model (company/department/team-scoped) -
  `POST /announcements` (HR/Admin) resolves the actual audience and
  notifies everyone in it; `GET /announcements` returns what's relevant to
  *you* specifically (company-wide + your department + your team, not
  everything)
- **`Recognition`** model - any employee can recognize any other
  (teamwork/leadership/innovation/helping/excellence + a message), notifies
  the recipient, and everyone can see a company-wide feed as well as their
  own received/given history
- **`Message`** model supporting both direct messages and team channels
  (exactly one of `recipient`/`team` is set, enforced in the service layer).
  `getInbox()` builds a contact list with last-message-preview and
  per-contact unread counts by walking the message list once in JS rather
  than a Mongo aggregation pipeline - simpler to read, and fine at this
  scale. Team channels are scoped to actual membership (`assertTeamMember`)
- The notification bell (built in Phase 5) needed no changes - it's generic
  over `type`/`title`/`message`/`link`, so every new notification type here
  just slots in

**Frontend additions**
- Shared **Announcements** page (one component, all roles) - everyone sees
  a feed, HR/Admin additionally get a publish button and delete action
- Shared **Recognition** page - a feed/received/given tab switcher and a
  "give recognition" modal
- Shared **Messages** page - a two-pane layout: contacts + team channels on
  the left (unread badges), the active thread on the right, with a "new
  conversation" picker. Same 30s-poll-not-yet-websocket approach as the
  notification bell; deep-links from notifications (`?with=` / `?team=`)
  land directly on the right conversation

```

### How to test Phase 8

1. As `hr`/`admin`: go to **Announcements**, publish one scoped to a
   specific department. Log in as someone in that department - confirm
   they see it and got notified; log in as someone in a *different*
   department - confirm they don't see it.
2. As any employee: go to **Recognition**, give someone a shout-out. Check
   it shows in the company feed, in your "given" tab, and in their
   "received" tab - and that they got notified.
3. As any employee: go to **Messages**, start a new conversation with a
   coworker, send a message. Log in as that coworker - confirm the unread
   badge shows in their contact list, the message appears, and it's marked
   read once they open the thread.
4. If you're on a team (Phase 3): open its channel under "Team channels" in
   **Messages**, send a message - confirm other team members (not just the
   manager) get notified and can see/reply in the same channel.
5. As `hr`/`admin`: create a task (Phase 6) due within the next few hours,
   then hit `POST /notifications/check-task-deadlines` directly (no UI
   button for this one - it's meant to be a backend/cron trigger). Confirm
   the assignee gets a "due soon" notification, and that running the sweep
   again doesn't send a second one for the same task.

## Phase 7: Goals + performance analytics

**Backend additions**
- `Goal` model: title/description/progress (0-100, drives status
  automatically: 0 → not-started, 1-99 → in-progress, 100 → completed),
  optional due date, `createdBy` (self or a manager/HR/Admin)
- `POST /goals`: employees can only create goals for themselves; managers
  can create for themselves or their own team; HR/Admin for anyone
- `PATCH /goals/:id` (owner only): edit details and log progress - status
  updates automatically from the progress value
- `POST /goals/:id/review` (manager/HR/Admin, team-scoped for managers):
  the "review" step from the brief - set status directly (e.g. approve as
  completed, or cancel) with an optional comment that shows up on the
  employee's card
- `Performance` model: one snapshot per employee/month/year. Six factors -
  task completion rate, on-time delivery rate, quality score, collaboration
  score, goals-achieved rate, and reliability score (**this is literally
  the Phase 4 attendance percentage for that month** - a clean example of
  reusing what earlier phases already computed rather than inventing a
  second measure of the same thing)
- **`weightedAverage()`** in `performance.service.js`: the contribution
  score is a weighted average of those six factors, but any factor with no
  data for the period (e.g. no tasks were due that month) is dropped and
  the remaining weights are renormalized - so a slow month for one metric
  doesn't unfairly tank the score, and a new hire isn't penalized for
  goals/tasks that don't exist yet. Verified by hand: with one factor
  (goals) missing, five remaining weights totaling 90 correctly renormalize
  to produce the right weighted result
- Quality and collaboration scores are **always manager-entered**, never
  auto-computed - the system doesn't invent a number for something
  genuinely subjective. Everything else is recomputed fresh every time a
  snapshot is viewed, so it always reflects current task/goal/attendance
  data, while manager-entered fields and feedback history persist
  (`getOrCreateSnapshot` in `performance.service.js`)
- Workload label (low/balanced/high) rides along as context on each
  snapshot, reusing `computeTaskStats` from Phase 6 rather than
  recalculating it - **the brief's "don't label people, only the load"
  rule is enforced in exactly one place** in the codebase
- `GET /performance/me`, `/me/history` (trend), `/team` (manager, with a
  team average), `/:employeeId` (manager/HR/Admin), and
  `POST /:employeeId/feedback` (manager/HR/Admin, team-scoped for managers)
  to set quality/collaboration scores and leave a comment

**Frontend additions**
- Employee **Goals** page: goal cards with a progress slider, and **Performance**
  page: contribution score, a full metric breakdown, manager feedback, and
  a small trend chart across recent months
- Manager **Team goals** page (assign + review) and **Team performance**
  page (per-member scores + a "give feedback" modal)
- HR/Admin equivalents with employee/period pickers instead of an implicit
  "my team"
- Employee dashboard now also shows active goals and a performance summary
  tile

```

### How to test Phase 7

1. As an `employee`: go to **Goals**, add one, drag the progress slider and
   save - watch the status label move from "not started" to "in progress"
   automatically.
2. As their manager: go to **Team goals**, review it - set it to
   "completed" with a comment. Back as the employee, confirm the comment
   shows on the goal card and the status/progress updated.
3. As the employee: go to **Performance** - with no tasks/goals due yet
   this month, most factors should show "No data yet" rather than a
   misleading 0%, and the contribution score should still compute from
   whatever data *does* exist (attendance, mainly, via reliability score).
4. Complete a couple of tasks on time (Phase 6) and a goal within the
   current month, then revisit **Performance** - task completion, on-time
   delivery, and goals-achieved rates should now be populated and the
   contribution score should reflect them.
5. As the manager: go to **Team performance**, give someone a quality/
   collaboration score and a comment. Confirm it shows up on their
   Performance page and the contribution score updates accordingly.
6. As `hr`/`admin`: go to **Performance**, pick any employee (not just
   people on "your" team, since HR/Admin aren't scoped) and a past month -
   confirm the period picker actually changes which snapshot you're
   looking at.

## Phase 6: Task management

**Backend additions**
- `Task` model: title/description, `assignee` + `assignedBy` (both
  `Employee` refs), optional `team`, priority (low/medium/high/urgent),
  status (`TODO` → `IN_PROGRESS` → `REVIEW` → `COMPLETED`/`BLOCKED`), due
  date, estimated/actual hours, and `completedAt` (auto-set/cleared as
  status moves in and out of `COMPLETED`)
- `POST /tasks` (manager/HR/Admin): a manager can only assign to their own
  team's members (checked via team membership, not just `Employee.manager`,
  so it works however a team was set up); HR/Admin can assign to anyone.
  Assigning notifies the employee
- `PATCH /tasks/:id/status` (the assignee only): the narrow, employee-facing
  endpoint - just status and optionally logging actual hours so far.
  Notifies whoever assigned the task when it moves
- `PATCH /tasks/:id` / `DELETE /tasks/:id` (manager/HR/Admin): full edit,
  same team-scoping rule as creation
- `computeTaskStats()` in `task.service.js` - a small pure function (list
  of tasks in, `{ completionPercentage, overdue, active, workloadLabel }`
  out) so completion %, overdue detection, and workload labeling are
  computed the same way everywhere they're used, and are easy to unit-test
  in isolation from the database. Workload is intentionally reported as
  **low / balanced / high**, never as a judgment about the person (per the
  brief: no "lazy" labels)
- `GET /tasks/me`, `/tasks/team` (manager - includes a per-member workload
  breakdown), `/tasks` (HR/Admin, filterable by status/priority/employee/
  team/overdue)

**Frontend additions**
- Employee **Tasks** page: completion/overdue/active summary cards, a task
  table with an inline status dropdown (overdue rows are visually flagged)
- Manager **Team tasks** page: per-member workload cards (with the neutral
  low/balanced/high badge) plus an "Assign task" modal and the full team
  task list
- HR/Admin **Tasks** page: org-wide completion/overdue stats with
  status/employee filters

  src/routes/AppRoutes.jsx                   (new routes wired in)
```

### How to test Phase 6

1. As a `manager` (with a team assigned in Phase 3): go to **Team tasks**,
   check the workload cards show "low workload" for members with no tasks
   yet, then assign a task to someone with a due date in the past (to test
   overdue) and one in the future.
2. As that employee: go to **Tasks**, see both, confirm the past-due one is
   flagged "overdue" and highlighted. Move it through statuses via the
   dropdown - watch the completion % and overdue count update.
3. Move it to `COMPLETED` - confirm it drops out of the overdue count and
   the manager's workload card for that person updates (active count down,
   completed count up).
4. As `hr`/`admin`: go to **Tasks**, filter by employee/status, confirm you
   see tasks across every team, not just one manager's.
5. Try creating a task as a manager for someone *not* on your team (e.g. by
   hitting the API directly) - should be rejected with a 403.
6. Check the notification bell picks up "new task assigned" (as the
   employee) and "task moved to X" (as the assigner) events.

## Phase 5: Leave management

**Backend additions**
- `Leave` model (casual/sick/earned/wfh/emergency; pending → approved/
  rejected, or cancelled) and `LeaveBalance` (one doc per employee/year/
  type, with `remaining` as a virtual so it can never drift out of sync
  with allocated/used)
- A minimal `Notification` model + service, built now because leave status
  changes need somewhere to land - `POST /leaves` notifies the employee's
  manager, and approve/reject notify the employee. Phase 8 will expand this
  with more notification types and possibly a real-time transport; for now
  the bell in the header polls every 30s
- `POST /leaves` (apply): validates the date range isn't in the past,
  computes the requested day count as **working days only** (weekends and
  company holidays excluded, reusing the same holiday-lookup helper as
  Attendance), rejects overlapping requests, and checks remaining balance
  (allocated − used − *other pending* requests of the same type, so two
  simultaneous pending requests can't both later be approved past the
  allocation)
- `POST /leaves/:id/approve` / `reject`: manager can only decide on their
  own team's requests (checked via `Employee.manager`), HR/Admin can decide
  on anyone's. Approval deducts the balance and **writes Attendance
  records** for each working day in the range (`status: 'leave'`, or
  `'remote'` for WFH) so the two systems agree
- `POST /leaves/:id/cancel` (employee, own requests only): refunds balance
  and removes the Attendance side-effect for any day that hasn't happened
  yet; blocked once the leave has fully elapsed, to preserve history
- `GET /leaves/balance`, `/leaves/me`, `/leaves/team` (manager), `/leaves`
  (HR/Admin, filterable by status/type/employee)
- Configurable default annual allocations via `.env` (same pattern as the
  attendance settings)

**Frontend additions**
- Employee **Leaves** page: balance cards per type (with a "pending"
  callout), an apply form, and a request history table with cancel
- Manager **Leave requests** page: a pending queue with approve/reject,
  plus decided-request history
- HR/Admin **Leaves** page: org-wide list with status/type filters and the
  same approve/reject actions
- A notification bell in the header (unread badge, dropdown, mark-read /
  mark-all-read, click-through to the relevant page)
- Employee dashboard now also shows a leave balance summary

  src/routes/AppRoutes.jsx                   (new routes wired in)
```

### How to test Phase 5

1. As an `employee`: go to **Leaves**, check your starting balances (12
   casual / 10 sick / 15 earned / 60 wfh / 5 emergency by default), apply
   for a couple of days of casual leave starting tomorrow.
2. As their manager: go to **Leave requests**, see it in the pending queue,
   approve it. Check the notification bell shows the employee got notified
   (log in as them to see it, or just trust the `/notifications` API).
3. Back as the employee: **Leaves** should show the request as "approved"
   and the casual balance should have gone down by the requested day count.
   Go to **Attendance** for those dates - they should show status "leave"
   (not "absent"), and not count against the attendance percentage.
4. Try applying for overlapping dates - should be rejected with a clear
   error. Try applying for more days than your remaining balance - same.
5. Cancel a future approved leave as the employee - balance should be
   refunded and the Attendance "leave" records for the untouched future
   days should disappear.
6. As `hr`/`admin`: go to **Leaves**, filter by status/type, approve or
   reject something outside your own team (HR/Admin aren't restricted to
   "their" team the way a manager is).
7. Try applying for a WFH leave - on approval, check Attendance shows
   "remote" for those days (and that it still counts as present-equivalent
   in the attendance percentage, since WFH is still working).

## Phase 4: Attendance system

**Backend additions**
- `Attendance` model: one record per `(employee, date)`, storing check-in/
  check-out times, computed working hours, lateness, overtime, mode
  (office/remote), and status (present / absent / half-day / leave /
  holiday / weekend / remote)
- `Holiday` model (company-wide or office-specific) so attendance % excludes
  holidays from the working-day count, same as it already excludes weekends
- Configurable rules via `.env` (with sensible defaults): standard check-in
  time, late grace period, standard work hours, half-day threshold,
  attendance target %, which weekdays count as the weekend
- `POST /attendance/check-in` / `check-out` - self-service, computes
  lateness on check-in and working hours/overtime/half-day status on
  check-out
- `GET /attendance/me` and `GET /attendance/:employeeId` (manager/HR/admin)
  return a full month's records plus **computed stats**: percentage,
  breakdown by status, and **how many more present days are needed to hit
  the target %** (see `calculateAttendanceStats` in
  `attendance.service.js` - a pure, isolated function so the math is easy
  to follow and to unit test independently of the database)
- `GET /attendance/team` (manager) - today's (or any date's) status for
  everyone on the manager's team(s), correctly distinguishing
  "not checked in yet" (today) from "absent" (past days), and "weekend"/
  "holiday" from either
- `POST /attendance/mark-absentees` (HR/Admin) - bulk-marks anyone without
  a record for a given date as absent, skipping weekends/holidays. Meant to
  run once at end-of-day; Phase 12 is the natural place to wire this to a
  real scheduler (`node-cron`) instead of a manual button
- `POST /attendance/manual` (HR/Admin) - corrects or backfills a single
  employee/date record
- Full holiday CRUD (`/holidays`), HR/Admin-only writes

**The attendance-percentage math**, in plain terms: given how many working
days have elapsed this month (weekends and holidays excluded) and how many
of those the employee was present for, we solve for the smallest N such
that `(present + N) / (workingDays + N) >= target%`. That's what's shown on
the dashboard as "X more present days needed."

**Frontend additions**
- Employee **Attendance** page: check-in (office/remote) and check-out
  buttons, today's status, this month's % with a progress bar and the
  "N more days needed" message, a status breakdown, and a full monthly
  table with a month/year picker
- Employee dashboard now shows a live "today" + "this month" attendance
  widget instead of a placeholder
- Manager **Team attendance** page: today's (or any date's) roster for
  their team with status counts
- HR/Admin **Attendance** page: run "mark absentees" for any date, and look
  up any employee's monthly attendance/stats
- HR/Admin **Holidays** page: simple CRUD list

### How to test Phase 4

1. Log in as an `employee`. Go to **Attendance**, check in (try both
   "office" and "remote" on different days if you want to see the mode
   distinction), then check out. Watch working hours/percentage update.
2. To see lateness: temporarily set `STANDARD_CHECKIN_TIME` in `.env` to a
   time in the past (e.g. an hour ago) and restart the server, then check
   in - `lateByMinutes` should be non-zero on the record.
3. As `hr`/`admin`: go to **Holidays**, add one for today, then go to
   **Employees** → check an employee's monthly percentage excludes it (you
   may need to check in a day *other* than the holiday to see the effect
   clearly, or just confirm the "breakdown" doesn't add today's date as a
   working day if you check in on it anyway — the model still lets you
   check in on a holiday, it just doesn't count against you in the
   denominator).
4. As `hr`/`admin`: go to **Attendance**, pick yesterday's date, click
   "Run for this date" - any active employee without a record for that day
   should get marked absent.
5. Assign a manager to a team (Phase 3's Teams page) with some members, log
   in as that manager, and check **Team attendance** shows the roster with
   live per-person status for today.
6. Confirm the "days needed to reach target" message appears once an
   employee has missed enough days to fall under 75% for the month, and
   disappears (replaced by "You're on target") once caught up.

## Phase 3: Employee, Department, Team & Office management

**Backend additions**
- `Office`, `Department`, `Team` models, referencing each other and `Employee`
- Full CRUD services/controllers/routes for all three, HR/Admin-only for
  writes, read-only for everyone else (any authenticated user can browse
  the org structure)
- Employee CRUD extended: `createEmployee` (HR/Admin, creates login + profile
  with an explicit role), `updateEmployeeAdmin` (full edit incl. role/status),
  `updateOwnProfile` (self-service, narrow field set: skills/avatar only),
  `deactivateEmployee` (soft delete, default/recommended), `removeEmployee`
  (hard delete, Admin-only)
- Team membership is kept in sync automatically: adding/removing a member on
  a Team updates that Employee's `team` field and vice versa, so the two
  never drift apart
- Deletion guards: an Office can't be deleted while Departments reference
  it; a Department can't be deleted while Teams reference it

**Frontend additions**
- HR/Admin pages: Employees (table + add/edit modal, search, deactivate/
  remove), Departments (table + modal), Teams (cards + modal with a member
  checklist), Offices (cards + modal)
- Employee "My profile" page (visible to every role) - read-only org details
  populated from `/auth/me`, plus a self-editable skills field
- New shared UI: `Modal`, `Select`, `EmptyState`, `Banner`
- Nav updated per role: HR/Admin see Employees/Departments/Teams/Offices;
  everyone sees "My profile"

```

### How to test Phase 3

1. Log in as an `hr` or `admin` user (see Phase 2 instructions to promote
   one via MongoDB if you haven't already).
2. Go to **Offices** → add an office.
3. Go to **Departments** → add a department, assigning it to that office.
4. Go to **Teams** → add a team under that department; optionally assign a
   manager and check off some members from the list.
5. Go to **Employees** → add a new employee, assigning them to the
   department/team you just created. Try editing one, deactivating one.
6. Log in as an `employee`-role account → go to **My profile**, confirm you
   can see (but not change) department/team/manager, and can update the
   skills field.
7. Confirm a plain `employee` account gets redirected away from `/hr/*`
   routes (RBAC), and that hitting those API routes directly without the
   right role returns `403`.

## Phase 2: Project Setup + Authentication

This phase delivered a runnable skeleton: Express + MongoDB backend with JWT
authentication and RBAC, and a Vite + React + Tailwind frontend with
role-based routing.

## What's implemented

**Backend (`server/`)**
- Express app with security middleware (helmet, cors, rate limiting)
- MongoDB connection via Mongoose
- `User` (auth) and `Employee` (profile) models, kept separate on purpose
- JWT auth: short-lived access token (returned in the JSON body, kept in
  memory on the frontend) + long-lived refresh token (httpOnly cookie,
  scoped to `/api/auth`)
- Refresh-token rotation with reuse detection (a stolen/replayed refresh
  token invalidates the session instead of silently succeeding)
- `bcryptjs` password hashing (12 salt rounds)
- RBAC middleware (`authorize('hr', 'admin')`) demonstrated on a sample
  `/api/employees/admin-check` route
- Centralized error handling (`ApiError` / `errorHandler`) and a consistent
  success envelope (`ApiResponse`)
- Request validation via `zod`

**Frontend (`client/`)**
- Vite + React + Tailwind, dev proxy to the backend on `/api`
- `AuthContext` managing the in-memory access token + silent refresh on load
- Axios interceptor that retries a request once after a silent token
  refresh on 401
- `ProtectedRoute` supporting both "must be logged in" and "must have role X"
- Login and Register pages, role-based post-login redirect
- Minimal `DashboardLayout` shell with per-role nav and placeholder
  dashboards for Employee / Manager / HR-Admin

## How to run it

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 18+, a MongoDB instance (local `mongod` or a free
MongoDB Atlas cluster).

### 1. Backend

```bash
cd server
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env: set MONGO_URI, and change JWT_ACCESS_SECRET / JWT_REFRESH_SECRET
# to long random strings (e.g. `openssl rand -hex 32`)
npm install
npm run dev
```

Server starts on `http://localhost:5000`. Check `http://localhost:5000/health`.

### 2. Frontend

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

Client starts on `http://localhost:5173` and proxies `/api` calls to the
backend automatically (see `vite.config.js`).

### 3. Try it end-to-end

1. Go to `http://localhost:5173/register`, create an account (this always
   creates an `employee` role — that's intentional, see `auth.controller.js`).
2. Log in — you'll land on `/employee/dashboard`.
3. To test RBAC: in MongoDB, manually change that user's `role` field to
   `hr` or `admin` (e.g. via `mongosh` or Compass), log out, and log back
   in. You should now land on `/hr/dashboard`, and
   `GET /api/employees/admin-check` (try it with the bearer token from
   DevTools, or just note that an `employee`-role user gets a 403 on it)
   should return `200`.
4. Refresh the page while logged in — you should stay logged in (silent
   refresh via the httpOnly cookie), because the access token itself is
   only ever kept in memory.

## Why these choices

- **Access token in memory, refresh token in an httpOnly cookie**: the
  access token never touches `localStorage`/`sessionStorage`, so it isn't
  readable by an XSS payload; the refresh token is inaccessible to any JS
  at all, and scoped to `/api/auth` only.
- **User vs. Employee split**: auth/security fields and HR/org fields
  change at very different rates and are edited by very different flows
  (self-service login vs. HR editing a profile) — keeping them in separate
  collections avoids a bloated, permission-tangled document.
- **Public registration always creates `employee` role**: prevents anyone
  from self-granting `manager`/`hr`/`admin` through the public form. Phase 3
  will add an Admin/HR-only "create employee with role X" endpoint.

## Next: Phase 10

The Workforce Command Center: an interactive office/floor map showing
present/absent/leave/remote status per employee desk, with Floor/Desk
models, search/filters by office/floor/department/team, and a foundation
for real-time updates (Socket.IO) on top of the current polling approach.
